Common Nonsense is a midwest-emo band from west Michigan. This website provides a place for them to showcase their music and a blog for them to tell their story and produce content on a platform that they control. 

## Features

The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. 

The site is hosted on Netlify with continuous integration/ continuous deployment from Github. 

The site uses [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) as a Content Management system for the owners to edit and create new content on the site.

All of the style for this site was done using vanilla CSS. It is responsive and performant on mobile.
