Common Nonsense is a midwest-emo band from west Michigan. This website provides a place for them to showcase their music and a blog for them to tell their story and produce content on a platform that they control. 

The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. 

The site is hosted on Netlify with continuous integration/ continuous deployment from Github. 

All of the style for this site was done using vanilla CSS. It is responsive and performant on mobile.
